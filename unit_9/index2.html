			<h2>About Tarifa</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>From the very first day when I came to Tarifa, I had this homey feeling as if I belonged there even though my hometown is 3,500 km away. It turned out that I am not the only one. Once you come here and get to know the city vibe, its relaxing atmosphere and friendly people you will want to come back again and again or even stay for good!</p>
			<p>It is hard to say what it’s all about because Tarifa has so much to offer and as long as you are not all-inclusive type of person, this place will definitely play its charm on you. Chill beach bars, lots of sun, amazing seafood and strong wind is definitely what you will get here!</p>
			<p>However be aware that if you are looking for hotel chains and posh type of vacation spots Tarifa I simply not for you and you’d better go to one of holiday destinations in Costa del Sol.</p>

				<h3>The Beach</h3>
				<p>Fairly quiet even in summer season and you will never feel overcrowded, as there is enough space for everyone. If you have a car, or are ready for a longer walk, beaches further north, called Dunes Valdevaqueros and Bolonia await you. The landscape here looks like a desert but with brilliant views over the sea.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>The Old Town</h3>
				<p>The labyrinth of tiny, narrow streets, beautiful houses in white, and typical Andalusian courtyards–with bright blue doors and window frames–is just incredible! Even though the old town is not very big, you’ll get lost quickly in the small streets and suddenly be standing in a beautiful square. Calle Sancho IV el Bravo leads to the old beautiful church Iglesia de San Mateo, the Plaza de Santa Maria, and Plaza Miramar.</p>

				<h2>Kite-surfing</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>Tarifa is the kiting capital of Europe. Some people say that during summer season there is around 50 kite schools. I have tried two, which can definitely recommend but as there is so many it shouldn’t be difficult to find good quality classes. As instructors come from almost all around the world you can probably even find an instructor speaking your language.</p>

		<h2>Workation</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>I have to say I have never heard about this term before my trip to Tarifa.  What it means is work + vacation so if you have a location independent job, Tarifa might be one of those places to try out the digital nomad lifestyle. You can find more on this topic at: <a href="http://www.webworktravel.com/tarifa-digital-nomad-guide/">www.webworktravel.com</a></p>

				<h3>Bar El Frances</h3>
				<p>This bar is one of the few restaurants where you can get at six o’clock dinner. Here you have the choice to sit inside at the tapas bar, or out on their lovely patio. A particularly awesome dish here is the octopus salad and the baked eggplant with goat cheese.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>La Pescaderia</h3>
				<p>This is the place to go in Tarifa for fresh seafood. Grilled Octopus stewed on its own juice gives unforgettable taste.</p>

				<h3>Café 10</h3>
				<p>Awesome place for breakfast.</p>

	<article id="where_to_stay_section">
		<h2>Accommodation</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Just as there are some cool restaurants and cafes in Tarifa, you can also find a lot of nice accommodation of different price range! Be forewarned though, the coolest places fill up really quickly in the summer and can be much more expensive than in the off-season. You can find hotels, hostels, apartments as well as campsites on Airbnb and Booking.com</p>
		<section>
			<h3>The best season to come</h3>
			<p>Tarifa can get really crowded in the busy season! This usually happens in the summer months from June to August. Many people come for the kite surfing from all around the world! The normal population of Tarifa is 18,000 people but in summer the number can skyrocket to 90,000 people! The best months to visit are in Spring–April and May–as well as the early fall–September and early October. At those times of the year, it’s still nice and warm and there are way fewer people.	</p>

	<h2>Travel</h2>
	<hr>


		<p>Unless you are coming from UK and fly to the nearest Gibraltar airport, getting here is not the easiest. The best way is to fly to Malaga or Seville and then make the rest of the journey by car.</p>
